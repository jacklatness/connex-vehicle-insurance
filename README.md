## Prerequisite

1. Install Java 17. We recommend you use Eclipse Temurin builds [https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17], as they are open source and free.
2. Install Node.js from the Node.js website [https://nodejs.org/en] (please use an LTS 64-bit version, non-LTS versions are not supported)

## Setup Guide

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.

```
npm install
```

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

./gradlew -x webapp
npm start
```
