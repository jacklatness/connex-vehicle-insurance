## Prerequisite

1. Install Java 17. We recommend you use [https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17](Eclipse Temurin builds), as they are open source and free.
2. Install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/en](the Node.js website) (please use an LTS 64-bit version, non-LTS versions are not supported)

## Setup Guide

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.

```
npm install
```

We use npm scripts and [Angular CLI][] with [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

```
./gradlew -x webapp
npm start
```
